# Blog Web Application

BlogBuddy, Discover Your Digital Voice.

## Description

This is a modsmallest project aimed at honing my backend skills. Developed with Node.js, Express, and EJS, with Bootstrap aiding in layout and some custom CSS for personal touches. 

The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application. 

Please note that this project is still a work in progress; I'll be actively committing and updating it periodically.
